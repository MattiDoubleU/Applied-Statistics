    "What we have seen in the original design is the probability that she (randomly) selects the four correct cups is\n",
    "1 in 70 (1/70) or 0.014 hence a 1.4 % chance; and the probability that she (randomly) selects at least three correct cups is (16 + 1) / 70 or 0.24 a 24 % chance, 1 in 4. With the extended design those figures change greatly. The number of overlaps that occur increases but as outlined above, the probablility that she selects four correct decreases to 0.002 (1/495) or a 0.2 % chance. By looking at the calculated arrays we see that there are now logically 32 combinations to guess at least 3 cups right as opposed to 16 in the original design because the number of cups (tea first) has doubled from 4 to 8, so the probability that she (randomly) selects at least three correct cups under the extended design is (32 + 1)/495; 32 combinations plus 1 (the only combination with all 4 correct). The result is 0.06 or in 6 trials in 100 she may get 3 right and 0.34 or 34 % that she guesses 2 correct and there is 45% probability that she gets a least 1 correct (224 + 1)/495."
